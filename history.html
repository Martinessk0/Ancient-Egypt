			<h2>THE NEW KINGDOM</h2>
			<p>
				Ahmose I initiated what is known
				 as the period of the New Kingdom
				  (c.1570- c.1069 BCE) which again
				   saw great prosperity in the land under a strong 
				   central government. The title of pharaoh for the ruler
					of Egypt comes from the period of the New Kingdom; earlier
					 monarchs were simply known as kings.  Many of the Egyptian
					  sovereigns best known today ruled during this period and the
					   majority of the great structures of antiquity such as the Ramesseum,
						Abu Simbel, the temples of Karnak and Luxor, and the tombs of the
						 Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens were either created or greatly enhanced during this time.
			<p>
				Her successor, Tuthmosis III, carried on her policies (although he tried to eradicate all memory of her as,
				 it is thought, he did not want her to serve as a role model for other women since only males were considered 
				 worthy to rule) and, by the time of his death in 1425 BCE, Egypt was a great and powerful nation. The prosperity 
				 led to, among other things, an increase in the brewing of beer in many different varieties and more leisure time for 
				 sports. Advances in medicine led to improvements in health.
			</p>
    <p>Bathing had long been an important part of the daily Egyptian’s regimen as it was encouraged by their religion and modeled by 
		their clergy. At this time, however, more elaborate baths were produced, presumably more for leisure than simply hygiene. 
		The Kahun Gynecological Papyrus, concerning women’s health and contraceptives, had been written c. 1800 BCE and, during this period,
		 seems to have been made extensive use of by doctors. Surgery and dentistry were both practiced widely and with great skill, and beer was 
		 prescribed by physicians for ease of symptoms of over 200 different maladies.</P>

			<h2>THE OLD KINGDOM</h2>
			<p>
					During the period known as the Old Kingdom (c. 2613-2181 BCE), architecture honoring the gods developed at an increased rate and some of the most famous monuments 
					in Egypt, such as the pyramids and the Great Sphinx at Giza, were constructed. The king Djoser, who reigned c. 2670 BCE, built the first Step Pyramid at Saqqara c. 
					2670, designed by his chief architect and physician Imhotep (c. 2667-2600 BCE) who also wrote one of the first medical texts describing the treatment of over 200 different 
					diseases and arguing that the cause of disease could be natural, not the will of the gods. The Great Pyramid of Khufu (last of the seven wonders of the ancient world) was 
					constructed during his reign (2589-2566 BCE) with the pyramids of Khafre (2558-2532 BCE) and Menkaure (2532-2503 BCE) following.
			</p>

			<p>The grandeur of the pyramids on the Giza plateau, as they originally would have appeared, sheathed in gleaming white limestone, is a testament to the power and wealth of the rulers during this
				period. Many theories abound regarding how these monuments and tombs were constructed but modern architects and scholars are far from agreement on any single one. Considering the technology of
				 the day, some have argued, a monument such as the Great Pyramid of Giza should not exist. Others claim, however, that the existence of such buildings and tombs suggest superior technology which has
				  been lost to time.</p>
